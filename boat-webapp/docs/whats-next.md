# What's next ?

Many improvements are possible, i will describe some of them in this document.

## SSR - Server Side Rendering
Depending of our needs we could move to a SSR app, this will improve performances, SEO.
It might be done manually or using some specific tools like Next.js

## Test coverage
I didn't test all components, all features, and all usecases this should be improved

## Better code architecture
Some possible improvements:
. More reusable, smaller components.
. A centralized modal manager

## Security
JWT token should ideally stored in Cookies instead of localstorage

## CI
Setup CI tools to build, lint, and test our code automatically

## CD
Define our deployment process, and automate the releases.

## Logs and monitoring
There is no significatives logs nor any analytics/monitoring tools installed
