# What's next ?

Many improvements are possible, I will describe some of them in this document.

## Logs and monitoring

There is no significatives logs nor any analytics/monitoring tools installed

## Error handling

Most errors are not correctly handled, it is possible some error codes received on client side are not accurate

## Java docs and openAPI

Most of the code is self explanatory, but if it aims to grow it is important to document our code and API better

## CI

Setup CI tools to build, lint, and test our code automatically

## CD

Define our deployment process, and automate the releases.

## Security

JWT token should ideally stored in Cookies instead of sent in login response's body.

## Test coverage

I didn't test all usecase this should be improved
